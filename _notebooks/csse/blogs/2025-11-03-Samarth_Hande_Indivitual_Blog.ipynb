    "Our team did an amazing job with our game, and I played a major role in our sucsess. Our inital journey was admitedly rocky, largely due to the incapability of the main group to give out clear instructions on what they expected. We initally were asked to directly clone their repository for game development. This proved uneccisary later on, and gave the main group uncesisarry control over our pull requests. As they were continually late in their PRs, we decided to move to a repo directly cloned from the OpenCS Pages repo. This solved our issue, but caused large damages to our overall commit count and recorded contribution."
